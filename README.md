[Jymin](http://jymin.com/) - Tiny JavaScript for a Big World
============================================================

Jymin is a library of utilities for DOM manipulation, AJAX, Arrays, Objects,
Stings, Socket.IO and much more. You can use as much or as little as you want,
without bloating your front-end code.


Minification
------------
Jymin is "JavaScript You Minify", meaning Jymin scripts get concatenated with
your application code and minfied within a single function closure. Functions
your application uses will remain intact after minification, and functions you
don't use will drop out. The end result is that browsers will download and run
your code quickly, enabling the most responsive experiences possible.

Contributing
------------
Jymin encourages community code contribution. Since the library is just
getting started, please get in touch with Sam Eubank if you're interested in
contributing.
